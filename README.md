## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
- What are the various configurations of my resources?
- What are the relationships between closely connected resources like clusters, nodes, pods, deployments and jobs?
- Who can perform operations like list, get, read etc. on my resources?

Dashboards are available for 10+ resources, including Clusters, DaemonSets, Deployments, Nodes, Pods, Services, and more. Dashboards are also available for RBAC security controls, where you can check the assigned permissions to different resources.
