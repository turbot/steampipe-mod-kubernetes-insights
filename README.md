A kubernetes dashboarding tool that can be used to view dashboards and reports across all of your Kubernetes clusters.

## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
- Are there any publicly accessible resources?
<!-- - Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption? -->
<!-- - Is versioning enabled? -->
