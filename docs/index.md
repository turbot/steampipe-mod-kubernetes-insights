# Kubernetes Insights Mod

Create dashboards and reports for your Kubernetes resources using Steampipe.

## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many resources do I have?
- How old are my resources?
<!-- - Are there any publicly accessible resources?
- Is encryption enabled and what keys are used for encryption?
- Is versioning enabled? -->

<!-- TO DO -->

## References

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration, and `dashboards` that organize and display key pieces of information.
